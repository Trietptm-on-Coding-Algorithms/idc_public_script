# Name: objc-arm-xref-parser.py
# Author: Ben Nell, Intrepidus Group
#
# This script is designed to parse through the IDA Pro database (IDB) for an 
# ARM Objective-C binary and build method-to-method cross references (xrefs).
# The basic technique is to parse through the "__objc_methanme" segment, find
# xrefs to every method name string that come from the "__objc_const" segment,
# and read function pointers out of the "const" structures. 
#
# This is a quick and dirty, unscientific approach. We're taking advantages of 
# the heavy lifting that IDA has already accomplished for us and using it to
# squeeze out some additional functionality.
#
# CAUTION: This script has the ability to mess up your IDB file in a ways that 
# you will not appreciate. Back up your IDB!
