Objective-C Helper ChangeLog
----------------------------

31/Aug/2011
-----------

  - Bugfix: idc.SegByName was not returning segment start address but segment
  selector (seems a fix from HexRays), which caused an infinite loop.

  - Now objc_helper is more conservative about the method and class names as
  it requires them to be identified as ASCII by IDA.

  - objc_class now checks for the reference to the class definition to be
  valid inside __objc_const.


02/July/2010
------------

  - Added new script for static class analysis.


25/May/2010
-----------

  - Fixed a problem when tracking R0 register that was modified by
  previous calls. Now if the script is tracking R0 and finds a BX/BLX,
  it assumes that is modifying R0 and stops, marking the tracking as
  failed.

  - Changed the way the script parses the data references so it works
  both with release and debug binaries. Instead of getting the raw
  offset we now use recursive calls to idautils.DataRefsFrom().
  For the references to work properly we had to make a pre-process
  converting all dwords to offsets in the classrefs and superrefs
  sections.

  - In some cases, compiler can decide to use LR as a general register
  so the search for R0..R15 fails. Now the script includes the
  handling of this special case.

  - Added check of Thumb/non-Thumb code for patching the calls correctly.

  - Fixed bug that was getting the incorrect parameters for other
  flavours of msgSend(). Now it should be easier to add others.
